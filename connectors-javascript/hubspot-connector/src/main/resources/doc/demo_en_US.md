### How to Authorize?

To obtain an access token from Hubspot, you must first click on the authorize button which will redirect you to the Hubspot credentials page where you will need to enter valid login credentials. Once successfully authenticated, you will be redirected back to the configuration page, where you will see the message of [Authorization successful] and a temporary code will be provided in the redirect URL. At this point, you can test the connection and upon a successful result, proceed to save the connection and initiate the operation.
