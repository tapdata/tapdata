## **Connection configuration help**
### **1.  Doris installation instructions**
Please follow the instructions below to ensure that the Doris database is successfully added and used in Tapdata.
### **2.  Supported versions**
Doris 1.x
### **3.  Prerequisites**
#### **3.1 Create Doris account**
```
//Create user
create user 'username'@'localhost' identified with Doris_ native_ password by 'password';
//Change password
alter user 'username'@'localhost' identified with Doris_ native_ password by 'password';
```
#### **3.2 Authorization of tapdata account**
Assign select permission to a database
```
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, LOCK TABLES ON <DATABASE_ NAME>.< TABLE_ NAME> TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
Permissions for global
```
GRANT RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
#### **3.3 Constraint description**
```
When synchronizing from Doris to other heterogeneous databases, if the source Doris has a table cascade setting, the data updates and deletions generated by the cascade trigger will not be delivered to the target. If you need to build a cascade processing capability at the target end, you can achieve this type of data synchronization through triggers and other means depending on the target situation.
```
###  **4.  Prerequisites (as targets)**
Assign all permissions to a database
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <DATABASE_ NAME>.< TABLE_ NAME> TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
Permissions for global
```
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'tapdata' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
###  **5.  Common errors**
Unknown error 1044
If the permission has been granted, but the connection cannot be tested through tapdata, you can check and repair it through the following steps
```
SELECT host,user,Grant_ priv,Super_ priv FROM Doris.user where user='username';
//View Grant_ Whether the value of priv field is Y
//If not, execute the following command
UPDATE Doris.user SET Grant_ priv='Y' WHERE user='username';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
